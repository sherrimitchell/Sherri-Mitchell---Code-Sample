**OSEM Code Samples**
I served as an intern for the Rails Girls Summer of Code from June to September of this year (2016). Rails Girls Summer of Code is a fellowship program which helps foster diversity in the development community by providing women with scholarships to work on open source projects. During the program, I worked on Open Source Event Manager (OSEM), an event management tool tailored to Free and Open Source Software conferences. http://osem.io

* Open Graph Metadata - I added open graph metadata tags to the Event and Conference show pages to facilitate sharing with social media sites
* Room Events - I added the functionality to allow Conference Administrators to view events schedule information for each room. I added list of rooms and events to the dashboard. An Administrator can select a room and from the list and display the schedule information, speaker info, and event title.
