# Code-Samples for Sherri Mitchell

Hi. My name is Sherri Mitchell. I am a developer and I have been creating projects using Ruby on Rails for about 2 years. I interned with Rails Girls Summer of Code from July to September this year (2016) working on an Open Source project. I also work on different projects to try out new things and help solidify my understanding of Ruby and Object Oriented programming.

This repository contains samples from projects that I have created as well as contributions to other projects.
