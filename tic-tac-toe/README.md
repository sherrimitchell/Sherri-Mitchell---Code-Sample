**TIC-TAC-TOE**
* I created this tic-tac-toe game as one of my first programs. It is played from the command line, and prompts the user to continue playing until the user completes the game. It was a great exercise for practicing some fundamental ruby concepts and methods: arrays, puts statements, fetching user input, looping, and initializing a program.
